# Package Tracker

A web app built using Google OAuth2 and Gmail API to analyze a user's emails and display tracking information on packages in the past 90 days.

## Possible Next Steps

- Incorporating a backend/DB to store user data
- AI/ML to more accurately determine if email contains tracking information
- Adding functionality for Amazon (would require logging into Amazon)
