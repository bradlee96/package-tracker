# Package Tracker

A web app built using Google OAuth2 and Gmail API to analyze a user's emails and display tracking information on packages in the past 90 days.

This app may show up as "unverified" during the Google Sign-in process as it is not verified by Google and therefore still in "testing." 

## How To Use

Head over to https://bradlee96.github.io/package-tracker/. Simply sign in using Google and press the 'Analyze emails' button!

## Possible Next Steps

- Incorporating a backend/DB to store user data
- Using a web scraper or courier APIs to get current shipping status
- AI/ML to more accurately determine if email contains tracking information
- Adding functionality for Amazon (would require logging into Amazon)
